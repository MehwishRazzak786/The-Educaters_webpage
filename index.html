                    <p>Established in November 1975 as the Les Anges Montessori Academy for toddlers, Beaconhouse has since grown into a global network of private schools, institutes, and universities, imparting distinctive and meaningful education to students from pre-school to post-graduation. The Educators, a Project of Beaconhouse, has completed more than 20 years of service to educational development across the country with remarkable success. Established in 2002, it now has 1,000+ campuses & the market leader in Pakistan's educational landscape with a presence in over 275+ cities and a student strength exceeding 225,000+. This makes The Educators outreach the largest compared to any other private school in the world.</p>

                    <h2>EDUCATION PROGRAMS</h2>
                    <P>The Educaters curriculum is designed to meet the needs of the 21st century, of individual students as well as the needs of local and global communities. As Beaconhouse welcomes a diverse student population and endeavours to provide inclusive and holistic education for all, it is expanding its educational support system to include the provision of Special Education Needs (SEN). These services are presently available only at some of our campuses and will be expanded to more schools across the three regions.<br>Their objective is to enable equal opportunities for diverse learners to meet their academic, social, emotional and physical needs through a broad, balanced academic and social curriculum. They offer intensive, research-based, targeted interventions - typically in the core areas of literacy and numeracy - and also help with study skills and organization, as well as behavioral/emotional support. Students are included in all aspects of school life to ensure that all are given the opportunity to contribute to the academic, social and cultural activities of the school.At Beaconhouse, Professional Development (PD) and training is undertaken by staff to maintain and advance their skills, knowledge and competencies, specifically as they relate and add value to the job and workplace. It is a dynamic process that is achieved not only through participation in formal coursework but also through School-Based Professional Development (SBPD), professional experience, collaboration, mentoring and participation in activities of professional organisations, as well as independent study, research and reflection.</P>
